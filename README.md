# C3D Community

This is the official repository of **C3D Community CIC**, a non-profit
organisation created to benefit the global community of researchers and
practitioners in the field of movement analysis, with a particular focus
on use of the C3D file format, which has become a de-facto community standard
for exchange of movement analysis data.

A key part of our work is to maintain the [c3d.org](https://c3d.org) website
as a tool for the community.  This site was created and previously maintained
by Edi Cramp of Motion Lab Systems over many years until his retirement in
2024.

C3D Community CIC is run by its members on a voluntary basis, and our work is
based on the following agreed values:

 * The legacy of movement analysis data and software build around the C3D
   format represent an asset to humanity.
 * It is a social good to continue to document and promote access to this
   data format and tools.
 * Public domain transparent data formats facilitate innovation and
   productivity, and further the field of movement analysis.
 * Data interchange between C3D and other formats is an important aspect of
   transparency.
